JavaScript ES6 Features and Best Practices Repository
This repository is dedicated to showcasing and providing examples of modern JavaScript (ES6+) features and their best practices. The project demonstrates the most important ES6 enhancements, including but not limited to:

Arrow Functions: More concise syntax for writing functions.
Block-Scoped Variables: let and const for proper scoping.
Template Literals: Easy string interpolation and multi-line strings.
Destructuring Assignment: Extracting values from arrays and objects.
Default Parameters: Defining default values for function parameters.
Rest and Spread Operators: Efficient handling of function arguments and object/array manipulation.
Classes and Inheritance: Modern OOP-style syntax for prototypes.
Modules: Use of import and export for modularity and better code organization.
Promises and async/await: Managing asynchronous operations with cleaner syntax.
